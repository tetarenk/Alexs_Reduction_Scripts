GILDAS/CLASS Cheat Sheet for Reducing IRAM 30m OTF Data

The following are my notes that attempt to decifer the nearly impossible
to parse document that is the CLASS "cookbook"; found here-->
https://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/doc/pdf/class.pdf
########################################################################

1. Your starting point is pipeline calibrated *.30m files for each day of 
observations. These files contain everything: all calibration data, all target
sources, all lines, all scans. To obtian this data you should be able to rsync
these files (using your observer account) off of the IRAM computers.

2. First you will need to install and start up GILDAS/CLASS.

After installing GILDAS, your bashrc (or equivalent in another shell) should have
something like the following,

export GAG_ROOT_DIR=/jcmt_sw/CLASS/GILDAS-feb18c/gildas-exe-feb18c
export GAG_EXEC_SYSTEM=x86_64-redhat6.9-gfortran
alias gildas="source $GAG_ROOT_DIR/etc/bash_profile"

Then to startup the software,
gildas
class

3. To simply load in a file and list its contents (e.g., target sources, lines, scans),

file in *.30m	! loads data set
list in /toc	! lists "table of contents" for data
find 	! build index of files
list /scan /brief	! lists scans

4. To create a file that only contains 1 source and 1 line,

file out OUTNAME single	! create output file
find /line LINE /source SOURCE 	! select data of 1 source and 1 line
copy	! copy the selcted data to output file
file in OUTNAME 	! read in newly created file

Now do a consistency check. I have no idea what this is acutally checking, but
nothing else will work unless the file passes this test.

set nomatch
find
consistency

5. Merge data sets from different days,

set tel *	! select all detectors
file out merged_SOURCE_LINE single /over 	! create output file
file in DAY1.30m 	! read in first file
list in /toc 	! list contents of first file
find /line LINE /source SOURCE 	! select desired line/source from first file
copy 	!copy selected data from first file into output file
file in DAY2.30m 	! repeat procedure for all other files you want to merge
list in /toc
find /line LINE /source SOURCE
copy
file in merged_SOURCE_LINE 	! read in merged file
set nomatch 	! run consistency check again
find
consistency
list in /toc 	! double check that merged file contains what you want

6. Now to actually examine the data,

(a) To plot an average of all spectra,

file in merged_SOURCE_LINE 	! read in merged file
find 	! build index of spectra
set nomatch
set align f c
average 	! average all spectra in data set
set unit v f 	! unit is velocity
plot 	! plot averaged spectra

##to change ref frequency,
modify frequency [reffreq]

2D spectra plot (i.e., x-axis is velocity, y-axis is spectra number, z-axis is line intensity):

file in merged_SOURCE_LINE 	! read in merged file
find /tel TEL_NAME 	! select a single detector instead of all of them (you find these in the list /toc output)
load 	! load in index of all spectra
set mode x -5 5 	! set x-axis (velocity) limits
set mode z 5000 12000 	! set z axis (spectra #) limits
set mode y -1 1 	! set y axis (intensity) limits
plot /index 	! plot 2D spectra


6. Next you need to do baselining,

a) first test on average of all spectra to find good baseline model,

file in merged_SOURCE_LINE 	! read in merged file
set nomatch 	! consistency check
find
consistency
set nomatch
set align f c
average 	! plot averaged spectra to test baseline model
set unit v f 	! set unit to velocity
set mode x -20 40 	! set velocity range
plot 	! plot averaged spectra
set window -3 25 -10 -4 	! make a window around all lines/spikes; syntax is add a pair of values (lower_limit upper_limit) for each window
draw window 	! show selected windows on plot
base 0 /plot 	! start with fitting a polynomial of order 0 (i.e., a constant) to data outside set window
				! Now you can try a bunch of other polynomials by repeating same command with different order.
				! base sinus [amp] [period] [phase] does sinusoidal fitting with amp,period,phase being intial guesses
plot 	! plot the averaged spectra after correcting the baseline with the model from the last run of the base command


b) apply to all spectra

find 	! build the index of all the spectra again
load 	! load in the index again
file out SOURCELINE-base single /over 	! create an output file for result
get zero
quiet 	! this is supposed to stop printing to terminal to speed up process, but command doesnt exist??? Never mind then...
for ient 1 to found 	! loop over all spectra fitting a polynomial to the baseline, correcting, and writing to output file
get next
base 1
write
next ient
verbose 	! again this was supposed to turn printing to terminal back on, but command doesn't exist either???

c) create plots of baselined data,

#2d plot of spectra
clear plot 	! clear plotting window
file in SOURCELINE-base 	! read in base-lined file
find 	! build the index
load 	! load the index
plot /index 	! plot the 2D spectra

#plot baseline rms--> I think this is rms noise in the spectra of the different scans???
clear plot 	! clear plotting window
file in SOURCELINE-base 	! read in base-lined file
find 	! build the index
variable base /index
g\limit /var idx%num idx%head%bas%sigfi 	! plot using GREG (the g means you are working in the GREG plotting pkg?)
g\box
g\set marker 4 3 0.15
g\point idx%num idx%head%bas%sigfi
g\label "Observation number" /X
g\label "rms [K]" /Y

7. De-spiking

(a) Apply despiking to all spectra

file out SOURCELINE-fill single /over 	! create an output file for result
find 	! build the index
load 	! load the index
for ient 1 to found 	! loop over all spectra, despiking as you go
get next
fill -10 -4 /noise 	! Fill contaminated channels (i.e., the ones with weird spikes you identified in step 6a above) with Gaussian noise
write
next ient

(b) create plots of de-spiked data

#average plot
clear plot 	! clear plotting window
file in SOURCELINE-fill 	! read in de-spiked data
find 	! build the index
average 	! create averaged spectra
plot 	! plot averaged specta

#redo 2d plot of spectra
clear plot 	! clear plotting window
file in SOURCELINE-fill 	! read in de-spiked data
find 	! build the index
load 	! load the index
plot /index 	! plot the 2D spectra

8. Platforming check --> scan by scan basis check to see if there is a "platform" (i.e., discrete jumps in spectra) in the data.

(a) First list scans,

clear plot 	! clear plotting window
list /scan /brief 	! list scans

Output to terminal should look soemthing like this,

Current index contains:                                                               
   14: 13365   16: 10692   18: 10692   20: 10692   22: 13365   34: 10692              
   36: 10692  110: 10692  112: 13365  114: 10692  116: 10692  128: 10692              
  130: 13365  132: 10692  162: 10692

(b) Now loop through all scans, plotting 2D and 1 D spectra to check for "platform". If you have a scan affectefd by this,
one part of the spectra will be at zero baseline, and another part will have a non-zero baseline (like a step function).

find /scan 14 	! build the index containing only data from one scan
load 	! load the index
plot /index 	! plot 2D spectra

find /scan 14 	! build the index containing only data from one scan
average 	! created average spectra
plot 	! plot averaged spectra

If you need to correct, do this,

set sort none
file out SOURCELINE-plat multiple /over 	! create output file where multiple occurences of one spectrum enabled
copy 	! copy over data to output file where correction will happen in place
find /scan 14 	! build index of data only from offending scan
get first
define real ty /like ry 	! define an intermediate array of intensities identical to the data
get zero 	! reset index counter to zero
get next
plot 	! plot spectra
set window -200 -42.3 -22 0 90 100 	! put windows around all lines/spikes, as well as the piece of spectra at zero baseline (here -200 -42.3)
base 2 /pl 	! attempt baseline fit for piece of spectra with non-zero baseline
let ty ry /where rx.gt.-42.3 	! write baselined data for section of spectra that was just corrected to the array we created
set window -95 -75 -42.5 +200 ! put windows around all lines/spikes, as well as the piece of the spectra that was just corrected (here -42.5 to +200)
base 0 /pl 	! baseline fit of a constant for piece of spectra that was originally at zero baseline
let ry ty /where rx.gt.-42.3 	! now write the section of fixed spectra (stored in the array) back into data array
plot 	! plot corrected specta


9. Grid data to make a cube and output to fits file

(a) make table, grid table data to cube, view cube

file in SOURCELINE-fill 	! read in de-spiked or de-platformed data
let name SOURCE_LINE 	!set name of output files
let type lmv ! set file type
find 	! build index
load 	! load index
table SOURCE_LINE new /range -50 50 v 	! build a table of spectra in a velocity range (creates *.tab file)
xy_map SOURCE_LINE !  resampling of the non-regularly spaced spectra on a regular grid (creates *.lmv file)
go view 	! gives you a single channel map/spectra that is interactive, as well as an integrated intensity map

(b) other maps you can create

#channel maps
let name SOURCE_LINE
let type lmv
go bit
input bit

#spectra across region
let name SOURCE_LINE
let type lmv
go spectrum

#PV diagrams
let name SOURCE_LINE
let type lmv
go 3view

(c) rms in map
let name SOURCE_LINE
let type lmv
let first 1 	! select line free channel?
let last 1 	! select line free channel?
go bit
poly
mean

Output should look like this,

I-MEAN,  Found 12817 non-blanked pixels, of area: 8.5755E-06 Radians squared
I-MEAN,  Integrated intensity:-6.485984E-08 (Map Units * Radians squared)
I-MEAN,  Mean value: -7.56336E-03, r.m.s.:  0.64183
I-MEAN,  Min value:  -2.7983    , max value:   2.8658

(d) write to fits cube to analyze in less painful software

vector\fits SOURCE_LINE_final.fits from SOURCE_LINE.lmv ! output fits file created from input lmv file

10. Temperature conversion

#output cubes are in Ta*, so need to divide cube by main beam efficiency to get T_mb
#The IRAM 30m main beam efficiencies can be found here-->http://www.iram.es/IRAMES/mainWiki/Iram30mEfficiencies
##T_mb=0.59 at 230 GHz!

#use spectral cube to do division in python

from spectral_cube import SpectralCube
Tmb=0.59
cube=SpectralCube.read('SOURCE_LINE_final.fits')
cube.allow_huge_operations=True
cube2=cube/Tmb
cube2.write('SOURCE_LINE_final_tmb.fits')
